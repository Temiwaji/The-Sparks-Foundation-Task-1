# -Supervised-Machine-Learning
Prediction using supervised machine learning to predict the percentage of scores of a student based on the no. of hours.
This is a simple linear  regression task as it involves just 2 variables(i.e, hours and scores).
Dataset used was obtained from http://bit.ly/w-data

Upon loading the dataset and plotting the  distribution scores, it is observed that there is a positive linear relationship between the no. of hours studied and percentage scored.

The prediction shows that the percentage score of a student who studies for 9.25 hours is 92.7%
